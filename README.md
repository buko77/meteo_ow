Weather in CLI with Open Weather Map and Python

A tiny script , in Python, to get the weather forecast on 14 days.
I use Open Weather Map API, free and without registration.
For this purpose, I use the JSON format, french language, metric system.

The second script use matplotlib lib for a stat presentation.
